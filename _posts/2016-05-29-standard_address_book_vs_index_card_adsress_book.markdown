Understanding Object-Relational Mapping


Take for example having a standard address book sorted in alphabetical order, it has come to your attention that Mr. John Adams has moved and you no longer need his record in your book.

Removing Mr. Adams from your book would require you to:

1. Navigate to "A" index page.
2. Scan through many records down to the one matching “John Adams”.
3. Cross out the record 

After all, you are left with a page holding many records along some ugly patches.

But, what if the address book was an index card type
Removing Mr. Miller would be as simple 
Navigating to M tab
Removing the card that meets the condition of “John miller”
After all, you are left with an address book sorted by alphetical tabs with one less record that's all nice and clean.

The difference between 
In first scenario you had an address book with a page per alphabet where every “has many” records .

However in the case of index cards, you had a box with many tabs sorted alphabeticaly , each tab had many records where each record was its own  unique index card serving the purpose of its  record in itself giving you the ability to access the item in itself.

And that's what an object relation map is
Rather then saving a record in a database by its text you save it as its own object (I.e. index card).
